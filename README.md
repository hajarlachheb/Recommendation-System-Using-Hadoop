During our previous work to create a recommendation system that will allow us to recommend movies using the ml-100k dataset. We opted for collaborative filtering, and it is a method that will allow us to make automatic predictions (filtering) on the interests of a user by collecting the preferences or taste information of many users.
We used the ALS as a model. Indeed, the idea was essentially to take a large matrix and factor it into a smaller representation of the original matrix through alternating least squares.
We will find ourselves in the final with two or more matrices of lower dimension whose product is equal to the original one.
